These examples are to help recipe builders and users create and configure
optimizations using SrFit. Read through the examples and modify them to learn
how to use SrFit.

Here is an overview of the examples. It is recommended that you work through
them in the order listed below.

Basic:

* gaussian.py
    Introductory recipe building and configuration.

* debyemodel.py
    Introductory recipe building and configuration.

* debyemodelII.py
    Simultaneously optimize multiple contributions and data.

Advanced:

* npintensitycalculator.py
    Use diffpy.Structure to build a nanoparticle intensity calculator, and use
    this to refine a structure to simulated data.

* npintensitycalculatorII.py
    Use the calculator built in npintensitycalculator.py to simultaneously
    refine a structure to two data sets.

* nppdfobjcryst.py
    Create a nanoparticle PDF calculator using pyobjcryst and refine the C60
    structure to simulated data.

PDF Refinement:

* crystalpdf.py
    Use diffpy.Structure to model a crystal structure with PDF data using
    automatic explicit space group constraints.

* crystalpdfobjcryst.py
    Use pyobjcryst to model a crystal structure with PDF data using automatic
    implicit space group constraints.

* crystalpdftwophase.py
    Model a two-phase structure to PDF data.

* crystalpdftwodata.py
    Model x-ray and neutron data sets simultaneously to the same structure.
