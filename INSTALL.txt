======================================
Installing SrFit
======================================

Target Audience
-----------------------

The Alpha-6 release is an internal testing release. It is intended for Billinge
group developers. 

Platform
-----------------------
Billinge group workstation: morini.

SrFit and its dependencies are installed on these Billing-group workstations.
We do not provide an installer for SrFit and its dependencies at this time, so
you must be logged into one of these workstations (either physically, or
through ssh) to use the code and run the examples. If you have trouble running
the software, please see the troubleshooting_ section below.

Documentation
-----------------------

The documentation this release of SrFit can be found at
http://docs.danse.us/diffraction/diffpy.srfit-alpha6/.

Using SrFit
-------------------------------

Developers should read through and run the SrFit examples from your account on
one of the target workstations. 

The SrFit examples can be downloaded from
http://dev.danse.us/packages/srfit_examples-alpha6.zip. The `README` file
inside of the archive explains how to progress through the examples.

Note that SrFit has no user interface in this release. The purpose of the
examples is to demonstrate the programming interface of SrFit and to acquaint
the developer with that interface.

Troubleshooting
--------------------------------

 * Problem: I cannot log into lowslide, poirot or romaioi.
 * Solution: You must either be physically located at a target workstation or
   logged in via ssh. These workstations are located at
   `<workstation>.apam.columbia.edu` where <workstation> is one lowslide,
   poirot or romaioi.  If you cannot log in via ssh, please contact the system
   administrator, Pavol Juhas.

 * Problem: The examples don't appear to run, I only get errors.
 * Solution: You might not be using the default system environment. While
   logged into a target workstation, type ::
 
    echo $PYTHONPATH
 
   in a command terminal to check the value of this environment variable. Make
   sure that the first entry in the output reads ::

    /u24/local/bgPrefix/arch/i686/lib/python2.5/site-packages

   Note that there may be several entries separated by colons ':'.
   Also check the value of the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable. The first entry
   should be ::

    /u24/local/bgPrefix/arch/i686/lib

   If either of these entries is incorrect, reset the environment variables
   before running the examples. This can be done by typing the following into
   the command terminal ::

    export PYTHONPATH=/u24/local/bgPrefix/arch/i686/lib/python2.5/site-packages
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/u24/local/bgPrefix/arch/i686/lib

 * Problem: The examples run, but I get errors about the GdkCursor or the
   display afterwords.
 * Solution: Make sure that your ssh client is forwarding X11. If using OpenSSH
   from a command terminal to connect to a target workstation, be sure to pass
   the '-X' flag (run 'ssh -X' rather than 'ssh').  If using PuTTY to connect
   to a target workstation, see the
   PuTTY documentation at http://the.earth.li/~sgtatham/putty/0.60/htmldoc/Chapter3.html#using-x-forwardin.

 * Problem: None of these points addresses my problem.
 * Solution: Please contact the developers.
